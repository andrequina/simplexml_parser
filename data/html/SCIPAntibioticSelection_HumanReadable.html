Denominator Exclusion guidance:

The exclusion for patients who are clinical trial participants is limited to patients participating in a clinical trial for the same conditions as covered by the measure. Other clinical trials are not valid reasons for exclusions.

Numerator element guidance:

Vancomycin is acceptable for CABG, other cardiac procedures, hip arthroplasty, knee arthroplasty and vascular surgery if there is an increased MRSA rate facility-wide or operation-specific. For the purpose of using vancomycin for prophylaxis, it is expected that vancomycin is given ONLY if one of the allowable conditions is TRUE.</pre></div>
