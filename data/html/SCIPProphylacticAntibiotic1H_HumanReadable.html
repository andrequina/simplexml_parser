                  <div style="width:660px;overflow-x:hidden;overflow-y:auto"><pre>A goal of prophylaxis with antibiotics is to establish bactericidal tissue and serum levels at the time of skin incision. Studies performed in the 1960&#8217;s and 1970&#8217;s demonstrated that a common reason for failure of prophylaxis was delay of antibiotic administration until after the operation. In a study of 2,847 surgery patients at LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City, it was found that the lowest incidence of post-operative infection was associated with antibiotic administration during the one hour prior to surgery. The risk of infection increased progressively with greater time intervals between administration and skin incision. This relationship was observed whether antibiotics preceded or followed skin incision (Classen 1993).   Opportunities to improve care have been demonstrated and timely administration has been recommended. For example, at LDS Hospital, administration of the first antibiotic dose &#8220;on call&#8221; to the operating room was frequently associated with timing errors. Altering the system there resulted in an increase in appropriate timing from 40% of cases in 1985 to 99% of cases in 1998.</pre></div>
